# Chat with your data using SQL Database in Fabric, GraphQL and MCP Server.

This project builds upon the step-by-step guidance for creating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to make your data AI-ready. It extends the previous implementation by demonstrating how to expose the processed data—stored in a SQL Database in Microsoft Fabric through a GraphQL endpoint. Furthermore, it shows how to **Integrate GraphQL with a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server**, enabling agentic interactions with your data.

The RAG pipeline is automatically triggered whenever a file is uploaded to Azure Blob Storage. It processes the file by extracting textual content, identifying candidate information, chunking the text, generating embeddings, and storing those embeddings in SQL Database in Fabric. This enriched data is then made accessible via GraphQL and can be consumed by MCP agents through the MCP server, allowing for natural language interactions with your enterprise data.

        Use **On Success** connector of the activity to link to the subsequent If Condition _(Generate Embeddings Results)_ activity.

    11. Add a [**Functions activity**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-factory/functions-activity). The function “insert_data” associated with this activity executes a SQL command to bulk insert rows in the documents table created in the previous activity.Configure this activity as outlined below : 
        - General Tab,
            - Name: _Save Data_
        - Settings Tab,
            - Type: _Fabric user data functions_
            - Connection: : Sign-in (if not already) using your workspace credentials.
            - Workspace: _IntelligentApp_ (default selecteed)
            - User data functions: _file_processor_
            - Function: _insert_data_

            **Parameters:**
            - Name: _data_ 
                - Type: _list_
                - Value: _@activity('Generate Embeddings').output.output_
            - Name: _documentLocation_

                            concat(
                                concat(
                                    concat('https://' ,
                                    last(split(variables('source'),'/'))
                                ), 
                                '.blob.core.windows.net/'),
                            variables('container')),

## Troubleshooting

- When adding a Python library from PyPI to User Data Functions, you might notice an error, such as a wiggly line under the library name (e.g., _azure-ai-textanalytics_), like a spelling mistake. Users should ensure the library name is spelled correctly and then ignore the error by tabbing out to the Version dropdown and selecting the correct version. This transient error should resolve itself.

- The imported pipeline reportedly doesn't seem to preload with the parameter values. For each activity in the pipeline, ensure that the parameter values are provided and correct. Refer to the [**Blank Canvas**](#blank-canvas)  section for the required parameters and their values. 

## Execute Pipeline (Pipeline in Action)
  Let's put everything we have done so far into perspective and see the pipeline in action.

- Upload a PDF file,
  - Use the Azure Storage Explorer or alternatively Azure Portal and create a Blob container named _resume_.
  - Upload a PDF file.

  ![Create a Container and Upload a PDF File](/content/explorer.png)

- Pipeline execution review,
  - From the pipeline’s “Run” menu, select **View run history** and select the recent pipeline run.
  - In the details view, check to see if the status is **Succeeded** 
  - In case of a Failure, try to **Rerun** the pipeline using the rerun option.

- Review Lakehouse,
  - A folder with the same name as that of the container _(resume)_ is created.
  - The PDF file is copied from Azure Blob Storage to the Lakehouse files.
  
  ![Lakehouse Review](/content/lakehouse.png)

- Review Database
  - The document table should be automatically created by the pipeline.
  - Chunk data, embeddings, and other entity (candidate in this case) information (such as name, phone, email, and location) are stored in the documents table.

## GraphQL API 

So far, we've explored how a data pipeline ingests documents—like resumes from our sample dataset, extracts their content, and then stores the results in a SQL Database within Microsoft Fabric. This stored data includes chunked data, vector embeddings, and associated entity metadata.

In this section, we'll shift our focus to making that enriched data accessible by exposing it through a GraphQL API. By the end of this section, you'll have a fully functional GraphQL endpoint that lets you query documents using natural language, enabling flexible and efficient access to your AI-ready data.

Navigate to the SQL Databaes _datamart_ database in Fabric portal

### Setting up Database Objects
Execute the following [SQL Scripts](/graphql/stored%20procedures/) from the cloned repository in the order as listed below: 

1. [Create Scoped Credentials](/graphql/stored%20procedures/01-create_scoped_credentials.sql) sets up database credentials to access Azure OpenAI API key.In the script, replace the following values before executing,
    - _<<YOUR_STRONG_PASSWORD>>_ with a strong password of your choice (for example, _N'V3RYStr0NGP@ssw0rd!'_).

    - _<<AZURE_OPEN_AI_ENDPOINT>>_ with your Azure Open AI service endpoint (for example, _https://resume.openai.azure.com/_).

    - _<<AZURE_OPEN_AI_API_KEY>>_ with  your Azure Open AI key.

2. [Create Embeddings](/graphql/stored%20procedures/02-create_embedding.sql) is a stored procedure that leverages the configured embedding model to convert natural language to its embedding equivalent. In the script, replace the following values before executing,
    - _<<AZURE_OPEN_AI_ENDPOINT>>_ with your Azure Open AI service endpoint (for example, _https://resume.openai.azure.com/_).

    - _<<EMBEDDING_MODEL>>_ with the name of your embedding model (for example, _**text-embedding-3-small**_).

    - _<<API_VERSION>>_ with the API Version of the embedding model (for example, _**2023-05-15**_).

    You can find all of this information by logging into **Azure AI Foundry** and navigating to your model deployment.

3. [Similarity Search](/graphql/stored%20procedures/03-similarity_search.sql) stored procedure performs a vector      search using the stored embeddings to find relevant documents. It also supports predicate-based filtering, such as search by location. This is the primary stored procedure that will be used by the GraphQL endpoint.

    Within this Similarity Search stored procedure, there is an internal call to the _Create Embeddings_ stored procedure. This internal call must explicitly use **OUTPUT WITH RESULT SETS NONE**. This is crucial because it suppresses any result sets that the Create Embeddings procedure might otherwise produce. By doing so, it guarantees that only the Similarity Search stored procedure returns a result set. This singular result set is what the GraphQL API uses to infer and generate its schema definition. If the Create Embeddings procedure were to return a result set, the GraphQL API schema generation process would fail due to unexpected multiple result sets.

### Setting up GraphQL API

Once the _SQL scripts_ are successfully executed, its time to stand up your GraphQL API. 
Setting up a GraphQL API in Microsoft Fabric is very straightforward. 
Simply follow the [Steps to Create GraphQL API in SQL Database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/database/sql/graphql-api). 

When prompted to enter a name, use _smart_search_. On the **Get Data** screen select all objects, (ensure that the _similarity search_ stored procedure is checked), and then click on the **Load** button.
![Get Data](/content/graphql-getdata.png)

Your GraphQL API should be all ready to go! 
Simply copy and save the **GraphQL endpoint link**;we will be using it in the upcoming section to setup a MCP Server.

![GraphQL](/content/graphql.png)

In order to test the endpoint use the 
[Sample GraphQL Query Script](/graphql/query.graphql). To execute the script, click on the _Query_ tab, paste your script in the new query window, and click the **Run** button as shown below :

## Integrating GraphQL with an MCP Server
If you've followed along thus far, we've successfully created an ingestion pipeline to process documents (like resumes from our dataset) and built a powerful GraphQL API to retrieve that data. While this provides efficient data access, a simple search often isn't enough for truly intelligent applications. To move beyond basic retrieval and enable dynamic, multi-turn interactions, we need to introduce agentic conversation. This section focuses on setting up an MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server, which will expose our GraphQL endpoint as a specialized tool, transforming static searches into fluid, conversational experiences. 

Simply follow the steps given below to stand up a MCP Server:

1. Navigate to the _mcp_graphql_ folder.
2. Rename the file `settings.env` to `.env`.
3. Replace **<<Your FABRIC_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT>>** with the **GraphQL endpoint link** obtained in the previous section.
4. Configure Your MCP Client:

    For Claude, 
    - Navigate to File -> Settings -> Developer -> Edit Config
    - Use the template [claude_desktop_config.json](/mcp-graphql/claude_desktop_config.json) as reference.
    - Replace _<<DIRECTORY_PATH>>_ with the absolute path to your mcp_graphql.py file (for example, _"C:\\\fabric-sqldb-ai-ragpipeline\\\mcp-graphql\\\mcp_graphql.py"_).

    For more information on configuring Claude desktop, refer to the [documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.info/docs/quickstart/user/).

    For VS Code GitHub,

    - Follow the [steps](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers) to configure MCP Server.
    - Use the template [settings.json](/mcp-graphql/settings.json) as reference.
    - Replace _<<DIRECTORY_PATH>>_ with the absolute path to your mcp_graphql.py file (for example, _"C:\\\fabric-sqldb-ai-ragpipeline\\\mcp-graphql\\\mcp_graphql.py"_).

5. Restart MCP Clients.
6. A new window will prompt you for **authentication**; please watch for it. Once logged in, you will be able to see the tools listed in the MCP Server.
7. Select **Claude Sonnet 4** as your model (recommended for its strong reasoning capabilities). 
8. For VS Code, select **Agent** mode. Then, click on the tool icon and select the _get_resumes_ tool.

    ![VS Code](/content/GHC.png)

9. For Claude, tool will be automatically selected.

### Agent in Action

You are all set, start interacting with your MCP Client (Agent Host) using (but not limited to) the following example prompts

_"Looking for chef's resume. The chef must have foundational cooking skills but be exceptional in kitchen hygiene and organizational skills.
Share the candidates profile (link) with a short description, why they are a good fit !"_
